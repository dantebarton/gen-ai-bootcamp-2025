## Notes from testing the prompt with meta-ai Llama 3.1 70B 

The following was observed through each iteration:
- In the initial prompt with little guidance the model gave the direct answer with little to no explanation
- Overtime given multiple improvements to the prompts instructions and how to handle different use case scenarios the model inched closer and closer to my expected output.

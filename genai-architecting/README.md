## Business Requirements

The overall goal of the company is to improve the learning experience for students between the instructor-led classes. This can be achieved through various forms of language practice ranging from writing to speech and vocabulary practice. We will take it a step further to provide insights on student progress and proficiency as they learn.

## Functional Requirements

The system must be capable of recognizing different speech patterns, recognize and provide suggestions for writing practice, and evolve the content difficult as the user progresses and improves. Furthermore through this approach they hope to develop an adaptive learning experience for their users. The current target is an active pool of 450 students, located within the Tokyo metropolitan area.
